        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
          My developer skills range from front end technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like React to
          back end with Node.js, Express, SQL and NoSQL databases like MySQL and Mongodb.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Eduardo and I am a 42-year-old Portuguese man, born and raised in Lisbon and living in Royal
          Leamington Spa, UK for the last 6 years. <br />
          Two years ago I found myself experimenting on creating a website and a tremendous passion/obsession for
          learning code, emerged. <br />
          My professional dream has since then changed to become a highly-skilled, successful software developer.<br />
          Although as you may have noticed I have been focusing my attention into Javascript and related technologies, I
          have the desire of learning other programming languages as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this, I have had a highly successful career in the hospitality sector, working my way up to Head
          Sommelier and Restaurant Director in high-end luxury venues. A career that was full of memorable moments and
          achievements like being awarded Sommelier of the year by Wine Magazine or placing in the top 3 for 3
          consecutive years in the most prestigious national sommelier competition in my country. My long and successful
          career in hospitality will hopefully be very useful in terms of transferable soft skill to my new and
          ambitious professional goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I discover this passion for coding, I've been learning as much as I can from online courses, tutorials
          and numerous websites from Stack Overflow to W3Schools or MDN. Finally, the opportunity arose with the first
          <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/cpd/coding-boot-camp.aspx" class="uni-link"
            >coding Bootcamp in the UK promoted by Trilogy at the University of Birmingham</a
          >. Excited with the perspective of having structured and intense learning, I immediately enrolled and I am
          currently in the final stage of the course while maintaining an excelent academic average.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Portfolio website, I am posting some of my freelance work to small businesses and also some of the
          projects made in Bootcamp that demonstrate the use of different technologies and hopefully will give a glampse
          of my skills to future employers, possible clients or recruiters.<br />
          If that's you, I will be looking forward to hearing from you.
