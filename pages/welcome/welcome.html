        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi and welcome to my Portfolio website. <br />
          My name is Eduardo and I am a 42-year-old Portuguese tech geek, born and raised in Lisbon. <br />Two years ago
          I found myself experimenting on creating a website and a tremendous passion/obsession for learning code,
          emerged. <br />My professional dream is to become a highly-skilled, successful web-developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this, I have had a highly successful career in the hospitality sector, working my way up to Head
          Sommelier and Restaurant Director in high-end luxury venues. A career that was full of memorable moments and
          achievements like being awarded Sommelier of the year by Wine Magazine or placing in the top 3 for 3
          consecutive years in the most prestigious national sommelier competition in my country. My long and successful
          career in hospitality will hopefully be very useful in terms of transferable soft skill to my new and
          ambitious professional goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I discover how happy coding made me feel, I've been learning as much as I can from online courses,
          tutorials and numerous websites from Stack Overflow to W3Schools or MDN. Finally, the opportunity arose with
          the first coding Bootcamp in the UK promoted by Trilogy at the University of Birmingham. Excited with the
          perspective of having structured and intense learning, I immediately enrolled and I am currently in the
          initial stage of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Portfolio website, I will be posting the projects I will be making in Bootcamp. For now, and just for
          fun, I have posted some websites I have made before starting the course and that are currently live. I hope
          you like them.
